        $transport = Email::Sender::Transport::Redirect->new({transport => $transport_orig,
                                                             redirect_address => 'shop@nitesi.com',

DESCRIPTION

    Transport wrapper for Email::Sender which intercepts all emails and
    redirects them to a specific address.

    This transport changes the To and CC header in the email and adds a
    X-Intercepted-To and X-Intercepted-CC header with the original
    recipients.
